This course is foucause on the coding lauange python.
Couse detile:
    1) At the start the couse will teach functions and viriables.
        * teaches you ways to sove smaller problems which can be combined to solve large probles.

    2) Next up the couse will teach conditionals.
        * conditions are ways you can do some thing if the outcome is true or false.

    3) After that the couse will teach you loops.
        * loops are the abalitys to do some thing over and over again untile you got your needed outcome.

    4) And then the couse teaches you exeptions.
        * exeptions are a way to tell your program to behave diferently based on what the input is, its a way to tell that the answer is not valid for your program, for example if you want an int value but the user gives an string value the exeption will catch it and tell the user thats invaid input.

    5) Next its liberys.
        * liberys are third party codes that some one else writes that have been tested many time and will work perfectly on all the conditions that it says.

    6) After the couse will teach you unit test.
        * Unit test is a way to test your code to make sure that noting goes wrong, also if some one else adds in some new lines of code you can test that their new added code dident break your code.

    7) And then the couse will teach you file I/O for input and output.
        * File I/O is the abuilty to accese and store infomations inside the computers file.

    8) Then the couse will teach you another technique called regular expressions.
        * Regular expression is used to search up patters and scan throw data finding what you need.

    9) The next up is object oriented programing.
        * object oriented programing is a way that you treat mutiple varibles at once for example if you have the car's length and the car's width you would have to time those two to get the base of the car but in object oriented programing you can set the object car's width and length and set the car's base equals to the length times width, so its easer to acces compire to setting all the width_1, length_1, base_1 you can just set a car_1 and it hase all the needed data.

    10) at the end of this couse you will get all the tools you need to continew learing other courses.
